Using the data of the Project for International Student Assessment on 25 nations, I show that cultural capital provides a relevant, but far from exhaustive, account of schooling inequalities; furthermore, the explanatory power of Bourdieu's theory seems impressively similar across countries. I also try to argue that, in order to elaborate a more satisfactory explanation, we need to take into account at least two more factors: occupational aspirations and economic resources. Finally, I discuss whether the above mentioned factors can be integrated into a coherent theoretical framework to achieve a better understanding of educational inequalities.},

Yet survey research data consistently show the absence of family background measure effects on high school grades. It is argued that conventional measures of family background fail to capture those cultural elements of status that make a difference in school interactions. Drawing on Weber's work on status groups and status cultures, and on Bourdieu's work on cultural capital, this paper reports the findings of an effort to assess the impact of one component of status culture participation--cultural capital--on one aspect of life chances--students' high school grades. A composite measure of cultural capital has a significant impact on grades, controlling for family background and measured ability. The pattern of relationships, however, differs strikingly by gender.},

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {In this article, we assess how the concept of cultural capital has been imported into the English language, focusing on educational research. We argue that a dominant interpretation of cultural capital has coalesced with two central premises. First, cultural capital denotes knowledge of or facility with ``highbrow'' aesthetic culture. Secondly, cultural capital is analytically and causally distinct from other important forms of knowledge or competence (termed ``technical skills,'' ``human capital,'' etc.). We then review Bourdieu's educational writings to demonstrate that neither of these premises is essential to his understanding of cultural capital. In the third section, we discuss a set of English-language studies that draw on the concept of cultural capital, but eschew the dominant interpretation. These serve as the point of departure for an alternative definition. Our definition emphasizes Bourdieu's reference to the capacity of a social class to ``impose'' advantageous standards of evaluation on the educational institution. We discuss the empirical requirements that adherence to such a definition entails for researchers, and provide a brief illustration of the intersection of institutionalized evaluative standards and the educational practices of families belonging to different social classes. Using ethnographic data from a study of social class differences in family-school relationships, we show how an African-American middle-class family exhibits cultural capital in a way that an African-American family below the poverty level does not.},

Indirect effect is defined as the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome via the mediator. Direct effect is defined as the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome that is not through the mediator. In this paper, we discuss the estimation of direct and indirect effects based on the framework of potential response models focusing on the 4-way decomposition. Direct and indirect effect estimations are illustrated with two examples where the outcome, mediator, covariate variables are continuous and categorical data. Moreover, we discuss the estimation of clausal effects and the effect decomposition in the settings that include confounder of mediator and outcome affected by treatment, multiple mediators, or time-varying treatment in the presence of time-dependent confounder.},

Then I will show how it integrates theory and empirical research. In the history of Sociology, the relationship between theory and empirical research has been a grand theme, and Bourdieu was committed to integrating the two throughout his career.　I will also examine the work of Blumer, an important predecessor to Bourdieu. While both his ``sensitizing concept'' and his ``definitive concept'' have limits, Bourdieu's ``open concepts'' which include habitus, capital and field have more possibilities and significances than Blumer's. The field is a social sphere which has a limit around itself and each has its own rules within. For Bourdieu, the field is considered together with habitus and capital, and also as a part of his theory of practice. The concept of field enables us to analyze social phenomena for which we have lacked a theoretical framework. We can also use the concept of field to relate and integrate differentempirical research. One example can be found in the study of social difference.　Bourdieu's sociology makes sense in combination with the works of other sociologists because it owes so much to them. We should ask the question ``Bourdieu and what else?'' rather than think in terms of a dichotomy such as ``Bourdieu or not.'' This will lead to a productive discussion.},

  abstract = {Mediation analysis has been around a long time, though its popularity has varied between disciplines and over the years. While some fields have been attracted to the potential of mediation models to identify pathways, or mechanisms, through which an independent variable affects an outcome, others have been skeptical that the analysis of mediated relationships can ever be done scientifically. Two developments, one more scientific than the other, have led to a renewed popularity of mediation analysis. The first, less scientific reason is that software developments have made it easier than ever to fit mediation models. Drag-and-drop interfaces such as AMOS, or the menu-driven PROCESS add-on to SPSS, have meant that researchers can easily test different models - often atheoretically in a \textbackslash (p\textbackslash )-hacking exercise - and get results that seem prima facie believable. However, it is entirely possible, and very easy, to utilize this software without any understanding of the assumptions mediation analysis requires to yield a causal interpretation. It turns out that many models that have passed peer review and ended up in scientific journals have no causal interpretation whatsoever. Simply drawing boxes and arrows, then hitting ``Run'' in the software of choice, is not appropriate methodology. In the second, more scientific development, statisticians from computer science, epidemiology, psychology, and political science have separately, but in a complementary manner, brought mediation into the causal inference framework. This has not only illuminated the assumptions needed to call a mediation model ``causal,'' but it has also created tools that allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their causal claims to unobserved confounders. The newer potential outcomes framework provides concrete definitions for mediated effects, which had been seriously lacking in the prior mediation literature. Does it make sense to study the effect of an intervention while holding the mediator constant? If so, how do we interpret holding the mediator constant when the mediator is affected by other confounders outside the researcher's control? Or should we hold the treatment constant and determine the effect on outcomes when we vary the mediator, which we might prefer if intervening on the mediator is cheaper than the treatment? The real-world consequences of mediation have until recently been glossed over, but the potential outcomes framework allows us to consider different scenarios. This blog post will review the history of mediation prior to its incorporation into the potential outcomes framework, when the focus was on determining the appropriate standard error for indirect effects. It then describes how the meaning of an indirect effect is more nuanced than most applications have given it credit for. The subsequent section describes the potential outcomes notation and the assumptions underlying the interpretation of a mediation pathway as causal. The final section provides three examples of when the old-school approach to mediation works and, more importantly, when it fails. Throughout, the discussion will, unless indicated otherwise, assume a binary intervention, a single continuous mediator, and a continuous outcome that is modeled as a linear function of the intervention, mediator, and (possibly) confounders. This is the simplest and most familiar situation. However, it should become evident that even in this seemingly straightforward scenario there are enough complications to show the reader how much care is required in interpreting mediation models. Moving into the world of categorical outcomes, and especially multiple mediators that affect each other, only makes things more complex. A Brief History of Mediation Take the following simple and familiar mediation model. \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) is a binary intervention that affects \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) both directly and indirectly by changing the value of the mediator \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ), which in turn affects \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ). This DAG corresponds to the following linear models: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[M] \&= \textbackslash gamma\_0 + \textbackslash gamma\_1X \textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y] \&= \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1M + \textbackslash beta\_2X \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] Substituting for \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) in the model of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) yields: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y] \&= \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1(\textbackslash gamma\_0 + \textbackslash gamma\_1X) + \textbackslash beta\_2X \textbackslash{} \& = (\textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash gamma\_0) + \textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash gamma\_1X + \textbackslash beta\_2X \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] The substitution makes it clear that the direct effect of \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) can be recovered as the term \textbackslash (\textbackslash beta\_2\textbackslash ) from a regression of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ). The indirect effect can be recovered as the product of \textbackslash (\textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash ) from regressing \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) on both \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ), times \textbackslash (\textbackslash gamma\_1\textbackslash ) from the regression of \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ). Whereas the significance of the direct effect can be found in the usual regression output, the significance of the indirect effect needs an extra step. Three ways of testing the significance have been proposed. First, an oft cited 1986 article from Baron \& Kenny suggested a three-step approach to assessing mediation: Regress \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) only. This first step establishes whether there is any relationship at all that could be mediated. Regress \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) only. This establishes that there is a relationship between \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and the mediator. If \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) is unresponsive to \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ), it cannot mediate. Regress \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) simultaneously. If the previously significant relationship between \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) disappears, the relationship is completely mediated. If the previously significant relationship is still significant, but the magnitude is diminished, the association is partially mediated. This approach still does not provide a standard error or confidence interval for the product term \textbackslash (\textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash gamma\_1\textbackslash ). Sobel (1982) therefore proposed applying the delta method to the system of equations defined above by the separate regressions for \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ). Recall that the delta method calculates a variance based on a linear approximation of a statistic \textbackslash (\textbackslash theta\textbackslash ). For a \textbackslash (\textbackslash theta\textbackslash ) that is a function \textbackslash (f\textbackslash ) of two random variables \textbackslash (a\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (b\textbackslash ), \textbackslash [ Var\_\{\textbackslash theta\} = \textbackslash nabla f(a,b)\^\{\textbackslash prime\}cov(a,b) \textbackslash nabla f(a,b) \textbackslash ] For the indirect effect we have \textbackslash [ \textbackslash theta = f(\textbackslash beta\_1, \textbackslash gamma\_1) = \textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash gamma\_1 \textbackslash ] The gradient vector is: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash beta\_1 \textbackslash{} \textbackslash gamma\_1 \textbackslash end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash ] So our first-order variance approximation is: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} Var\_\{\textbackslash gamma\_1\textbackslash beta\_1\} \&= \textbackslash begin\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash beta\_1 \textbackslash gamma\_1 \textbackslash end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash begin\{bmatrix\} Var\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1\} Cov\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1, \textbackslash gamma\_1\} \textbackslash{} Cov\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1, \textbackslash gamma\_1\} Var\_\{\textbackslash gamma\_1\} \textbackslash end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash begin\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash beta\_1 \textbackslash{} \textbackslash gamma\_1 \textbackslash end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash{} \& = \textbackslash beta\_1\^2Var\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1\} + \textbackslash gamma\_1\^2Var\_\{\textbackslash gamma\_1\} + 2\textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash gamma\_1Cov\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1, \textbackslash gamma\_1\} \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] When the models for \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) are assumed to be independent, as is typically done, the covariance term is zero. The standard error is consequently estimated by taking the square root of the variance: \textbackslash [ SE\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash gamma\_1\} = \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash beta\_1\^2SE\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1\}\^2 + \textbackslash gamma\_1\^2SE\_\{\textbackslash gamma\_1\}\^2\} \textbackslash ] where \textbackslash (SE\_\{\textbackslash beta\_1\}\textbackslash ) is the standard error for \textbackslash (\textbackslash beta\_1\textbackslash ) taken from the regression of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ), and \textbackslash (SE\_\{\textbackslash gamma\_1\}\textbackslash ) is the standard error of \textbackslash (\textbackslash gamma\_1\textbackslash ) from the regression of \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) on \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ). In large samples, the product divided by its Sobel-method standard error is distributed normally and can therefore be used to test for significance. The Sobel method is implemented in most software packages that perform mediation. However, it is based on an approximation that requires \textbackslash (N\textbackslash ) to be large enough for the sampling distribution to be normal. Because researchers do not always have the luxury of large samples, the third approach to assessing indirect effects is to rely on the nonparametric bootstrap. This method boils down to treating the sample as though it were a population, repeatedly sampling from the sample with replacement, calculating the product term on each bootstrap sample, and using the standard deviation of the resulting distribution as the standard error. The Troubles All of this is fine practice assuming the simple mediation model presented in the path diagram above holds. However, once confounders are introduced the situation becomes a bit more murky. And, for observational data, there are always confounders. A simple example taken from Pearl (2014) illustrates two problems created by confounders: direct effect estimates may be biased, and the meaning of direct/indirect effects is ambiguous. Take the following model: Here \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) does not have any direct or indirect effect on \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) except through the backdoor path \textbackslash (X \textbackslash rightarrow M \textbackslash leftarrow C \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ), where \textbackslash (C\textbackslash ) affects both \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ). Assume \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) are both binary and the model equations have the following linear specifications, with coefficients of either 0 or 1: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} Y \&= 0X + 0M + 1C \textbackslash{} M \&= 1X + 1C \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] The second equation written in terms of \textbackslash (C\textbackslash ) is, \textbackslash [ C = M - X \textbackslash ] The direct effect estimate of \textbackslash (X \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ) we would like to recover should equal zero. Yet if we control for \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ), as per the Baron and Kenny approach, we end up instead with an estimate of \textbackslash (-1\textbackslash ). Why? Controlling for \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) means that we change \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) from zero to one while holding \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) constant at, say, zero. In this scenario, with \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M = 0\textbackslash ), we get: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} Y \&= C \textbackslash{} \&= M - X \textbackslash{} \&= 0 - 0 \textbackslash{} \&= 0 \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] When we switch to \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ), still holding \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) constant at zero, we get: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} Y \&= C \textbackslash{} \&= M - X \textbackslash{} \&= 0 - 1 \textbackslash{} \&= -1 \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] Thus, changing \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) from 0 to 1 while holding \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) constant gets an effect of \textbackslash (0 - 1 = -1\textbackslash ). \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) is a function of both \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (C\textbackslash ), so holding \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) constant at zero would require \textbackslash (C\textbackslash ) to also change in order to maintain the equality \textbackslash (M = X+C\textbackslash ). To keep the structural model's integrity, we would need to introduce a counterfactual world in which \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) is forced to take on the value of zero regardless of \textbackslash (C\textbackslash ). This is equivalent to removing the \textbackslash (C \textbackslash rightarrow M\textbackslash ) path, which is not the same as statistically controlling for \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ). Defining direct and indirect effects therefore needs to be based carefully on what we think we can intervene on given the model's structural relationships. Are we interested in the effect of changing \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) from, say, \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (X = 0?\textbackslash ) If so, we need to understand what ``holding \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) constant'' means given the presence of confounders. Or are we interested in the effect of changing \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ), say from \textbackslash (M = 1\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (M = 0\textbackslash )? Are we interested in both? Switching to a counterfactual framework will force us to be more explicit about what we are manipulating and how we report direct and indirect effects. It also forces us to be explicit in the assumptions necessary to identify (estimate from data) these effects. The next section turns to defining the different types of direct effects we can estimate along with more concrete definitions. Potential Outcomes and Mediation The counterfactual approach to treatment effects is now well-established for non-mediation models. The idea is that every subject has multiple potential outcomes, one that occurs if the treatment is received \textbackslash ((X = 1)\textbackslash ) and one that occurs if the treatment is not received \textbackslash ((X = 0)\textbackslash ). We refer to a single subject's two potential outcomes as \textbackslash (Y\_0\textbackslash ) for the outcome when \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (Y\_1\textbackslash ) for the outcome when \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ). If we observed both of these, the treatment effect for this subject could be calculated as \textbackslash (Y\_1 - Y\_0\textbackslash ). However, we only observe a treated subject receiving the treatment; the non-treatment is the unobserved counterfactual. Alternatively, we only observe the non-treated subject not receiving the treatment; the treatment outcome is the unobserved counterfactual. While we cannot identify the individual-specific treatment effect, it is easy to show that we can estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) across all individuals in our sample. Mediation requires an expansion of the potential outcomes. We first have two counterfactuals for the mediator \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) given treatment \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ): The value of \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) when \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (M\_0\textbackslash ). The value of \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) when \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (M\_1\textbackslash ). We have four counterfactuals for the outcome \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ). The value of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M = M\_0\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (Y\_\{0M\_0\}\textbackslash ). The value of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M = M\_1\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (Y\_\{1M\_1\}\textbackslash ). The value of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M = M\_1\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (Y\_\{0M\_1\}\textbackslash ). The value of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (M = M\_0\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (Y\_\{1M\_0\}\textbackslash ). Of these four, only one is observed for a given individual, and the third and fourth will never be observed for any individual. The latter two may seem odd to consider at first glance. However, given these potential outcomes, we can state the following definitions (Pearl, 2001): The controlled direct effect (CDE): The change in \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when switching from \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ) if \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) were set at the same value for everybody. The natural direct effect (NDE): The change in \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when switching from \textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ) if \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) were set at \textbackslash (M\_0\textbackslash ) for everybody. That is, the NDE is the direct effect if the mediator were forced to take on the value it would have, for each individual, in the absence of treatment (\textbackslash (X = 0\textbackslash )). The natural indirect effect (NIE): The change in \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) when keeping \textbackslash (X = 1\textbackslash ) for everybody and changing \textbackslash (M = 0\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (M = 1\textbackslash ). Using counterfactual notation: CDE: \textbackslash (Y\_\{1M\_\{m\}\} - Y\_\{0M\_\{m\}\}\textbackslash ) NDE: \textbackslash (Y\_\{1M\_0\} - Y\_\{0M\_0\}\textbackslash ) NIE: \textbackslash (Y\_\{0M\_1\} - Y\_\{0M\_0\}\textbackslash ) Note that the \textbackslash (M\_m\textbackslash ) subscript for the CDE means that the value of the CDE will change depending on the value we set for \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ). In classical mediation modeling, the ``total'' effect of an intervention is partitioned into the direct effect plus the indirect effect. The NIE and NDE are defined so that the total effect \textbackslash (TE = NIE + NDE\textbackslash ). In the special case of a linear model with no treatment by mediator interaction and no post-treatment confounders, a CDE can equal the NDE. When this special case does not obtain, the CDE will be different from the NDE and cannot be added to the NIE to get the total effects. Nonetheless, the benefit of the CDE, as the next section discusses, is that it requires fewer assumptions to estimate. Thus, the direct causal effect of an intervention under specific values of the mediator can be recovered even in cases when the causal indirect effect is not identified. Being based on unobserved counterfactuals, all three types of effects are not identified at the individual level. As with ATEs in traditional causal inference, we instead focus on the average CDE, NDE, and NIE, as these effects can be identified from the data we do observe given certain assumptions are met. The next section turns to describing these assumptions and how they lead to identification of direct and indirect effects. Assumptions As a point of reference, consider the following mediation model with confounders: Here \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) is the treatment, \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ) is the outcome, and \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) is the mediator. \textbackslash (C\_1\textbackslash ), \textbackslash (C\_2\textbackslash ), and \textbackslash (C\_3\textbackslash ) are vectors of confounders, which may or may not contain the same variables. From Vanderweele (2015), we will make the following assumptions: A1: There is no unmeasured confounding of the treatment-outcome relationship. A2: There is no unmeasured confounding of the mediator-outcome relationship. A3: There is no unmeasured confounding of the treatment-mediator relationship. A4: There is no mediator-outcome confounder that is affected by the exposure. Based on the figure, these assumptions correspond to the following: A1: \textbackslash (C\_1\textbackslash ) contains all confounders of the \textbackslash (X \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ) path, is observed, and is included in the model of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ). A2: \textbackslash (C\_2\textbackslash ) contains all confounders of the \textbackslash (M \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ) path, is observed, and is included in the model of \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ). A3: \textbackslash (C\_3\textbackslash ) contains all confounders of the \textbackslash (X \textbackslash rightarrow M\textbackslash ) path, is observed, and is included in the model of \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ). A4: The only directed path from \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) does not pass through any intermediate variables. This would be violated, for example, if the path \textbackslash (X \textbackslash rightarrow C\_2 \textbackslash rightarrow M\textbackslash ) were to exist. The (average) natural indirect effect is defined as: \textbackslash [ NIE = \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_1\} - Y\_\{0M\_0\}\textbackslash mid C] = \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_1\} \textbackslash mid C] - \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_0\} \textbackslash mid C] \textbackslash ] We thus have two terms, \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_1\} \textbackslash mid c]\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_0\} \textbackslash mid c]\textbackslash ) that we hope to be able to write in terms of our observed data. Pearl (2001) provides proofs, based on standard expectation algebra, of how these assumptions lead to the identification of each term from observable data. \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} (A)NIE \&= \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_1\} \textbackslash mid c] - \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y\_\{0M\_0\} \textbackslash mid c] \textbackslash{} \&= \textbackslash sum\_m \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}[Y \textbackslash mid x = 0, m, c] \textbackslash\{P(m \textbackslash mid x = 0, c) - P(m \textbackslash mid x = 1, c)\textbackslash\} \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] This estimand is identified because all of the terms on the RHS of the equation can be recovered from the data. Pearl's notation may be unfamiliar to researchers who have traditionally worked in the regression-based Baron and Kenny world. Vanderweele and Vansteelandt (2009) show how regression can be used to recover the corresponding terms. Assuming that all four assumptions are met and the correct functional form is linear, we can specify two equations: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}(M \textbackslash mid X = x, M = m, C = c) \&= \textbackslash theta\_0 + \textbackslash theta\_1x + \textbackslash theta\_2m + \textbackslash theta\_3xm + \textbackslash theta\_4\^\{\textbackslash prime\}c \textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}(Y \textbackslash mid X = x, M = m, C = c) \&= \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1x + \textbackslash beta\_2\^\{\textbackslash prime\}c \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] where \textbackslash (c\textbackslash ) is a vector of confounders and \textbackslash (xm\textbackslash ) is a possible interaction between the treatment and mediator. Given a change in treatment from \textbackslash (x\textbackslash ) to \textbackslash (x\^*\textbackslash ), the treatment effects from a linear structural model are: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} CDE(m) \&= (\textbackslash theta\_1 + \textbackslash theta\_3m(x - x\^*)) \textbackslash{} NDE \&= (\textbackslash theta\_1 + \textbackslash theta\_3\textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash theta\_3\textbackslash beta\_1x\^* + \textbackslash theta\_3\textbackslash beta\_2\^\{\textbackslash prime\}c)(x - x\^*) \textbackslash{} NIE \&= (\textbackslash theta\_2\textbackslash beta\_1 + \textbackslash theta\_3\textbackslash beta\_1x)(x - x\^*) \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] As the examples below will show, these formulas reduce to the Baron and Kenny approach if there is no treatment by mediator interaction \textbackslash ((\textbackslash theta\_3 = 0)\textbackslash ) and all assumptions are met. Note, though, that Vanderweeele (2015) shows that it is generally not a good idea to assume no interaction is present. This is because: The interaction term allows for a fuller picture of the causal mechanism. Statistical tests that show non-significance of the interaction should not be trusted due to low power, which is often the case for interactions. Even if the interaction term is not significant in a regression, its inclusion can sometimes boost the power to identify other significant effects. The assumptions A1-A4 deal with the ability to measure and control for confounders. While this is no different from any regression model, the problem is made more complicated by the fact that confounders can affect multiple paths. Omitted variable bias is consequently a bigger threat to the validity of mediation estimates than traditional single-equation regression models. Interestingly, the multi-equation set-up of mediation modeling provides a unique opportunity to both test the robustness of results to unmeasured confounders and quantify just how large the effect of those confounders would have to be to explain away the causal effect. The calculations are based on the observation that, in the absence of confounding, the errors from the mediation model and the outcome model should be uncorrelated (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto, 2010). Tingley et al. (2014) have developed the R package mediation to perform the sensitivity analysis and present useful graphical summaries of the results. Vanderweele (2015) discusses an alternative sensitivity test that can also be applied to single equation models. Describing these in greater detail is beyond the scope of this already lengthy post, but the reader should consult the publications, as sensitivity analyses are becoming standard practice in mediation. Sensitivity analyses are great for testing the no-confounding assumptions A1-A3, but assumption 4 (no confounder of \textbackslash (M \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ) is affected by \textbackslash (X\textbackslash )) may be very strong. Indeed, it rules out using regression for models like the following: It is well known that conditioning an a post-treatment covariate can induce spurious correlations and should be avoided (Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen, 2016). Yet not controlling for \textbackslash (C\textbackslash ) means that the estimate for \textbackslash (M\_1 \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ) will be biased. The upshot is that traditional regression modeling cannot be used to partition total effects into separate indirect and direct effects that have a causal meaning. A variation on this is the case when there are multiple, non-independent mediators, as in the following: We label \textbackslash (M\_2\textbackslash ) now as a second mediator rather than a confounder because it is of theoretical interest. If there were no \textbackslash (M\_2 \textbackslash rightarrow M\_1\textbackslash ) path, we could still proceed using regression modeling and calculating separate NIEs. However, the presence of the \textbackslash (M\_2 \textbackslash rightarrow M\_1\textbackslash ) complicates things, and standard regression is either not an option or requires additional assumptions. This is discussed in several publications (see, for example, Imai and Yamamoto, 2013, and citations therein). On the other hand, it turns out that the CDE only requires assumptions 1 and 2. In the notation of Pearl's SCMs, we avoid the issues of a post-treatment confounder of \textbackslash (M \textbackslash rightarrow Y\textbackslash ) by simply disabling any arrows pointing at \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) and setting its value to a constant, as though we were intervening on the observational measure ourselves. Though we only intervene in theory, the result of doing so is an estimate of the direct effect conditional on the value of \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ). \textbackslash [ CDE = P(Z=z \textbackslash mid do(X = x), do(M = m)) - P(Z=z \textbackslash mid do(X = x\^\{\textbackslash prime\}), do(M = m)) \textbackslash ] This result may seem unsatisfying for somebody interested in a statistical test of the indirect effect. However, as Acharya et al. (2016) discuss, the CDE can sometimes illuminate causal mechanisms on its own. First, a nonzero estimate of the CDE rules out complete mediation by the mediator. That is, there is some causal path other than the one that passes through the proposed mediator. Second, if we assume, as is often done, that there is no interaction between the treatment and the mediator, the CDE and the NDE are equal. This means that one can recover the NIE by subtracting out the CDE from the total effect. Recall, however, that Vanderweele (2015) argues in favor of always including such an interaction effect. In addition, although identified, regression cannot always be used to estimate the CDE. If assumption 4 is in fact violated, the effect is still identified, but a different approach to estimation is required (Vansteelandt, 2009), or much stronger assumptions are necessary (Imai \& Yamamoto, 2013). Example 1 We'll demonstrate the problems under three different scenarios. First, we'll look at a case where the assumptions can be satisfied with appropriate controls and where there's no interaction between the treatment and mediator. Here there are two confounders. \textbackslash (C\_1\textbackslash ) confounds the association between \textbackslash (X\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ), and \textbackslash (C\_2\textbackslash ) confounds the association between \textbackslash (M\textbackslash ) and \textbackslash (Y\textbackslash ). Without proper control, these violate assumptions 1 and 2. First, we'll generate some data consistent with the model: \textbackslash [ \textbackslash begin\{align\} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}(M \textbackslash mid X = x, M = m, C\_1 = c\_1) \&= \textbackslash theta\_0 + \textbackslash theta\_1x + \textbackslash theta\_2m + \textbackslash theta\_3c\_1 + \textbackslash theta\_4c\_2 \textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathbb\{E\}(Y \textbackslash mid X = x, M = m, C\_1 = c\_1, C\_2 = c\_2) \&= \textbackslash beta\_0 + \textbackslash beta\_1x + \textbackslash beta\_2c\_1 \textbackslash end\{align\} \textbackslash ] set.seed(12345) C1 \% kable() Model Type Effect Estimate p.value No Confounders NDE 1.086 {$<$} 0.001 Confounder 1 NDE 0.508 {$<$} 0.001 Confounder 2 NDE 1.373 {$<$} 0.001 Both Confounders NDE 0.794 {$<$} 0.001 No Confounders NIE 1.310 {$<$} 0.001 Confounder 1 NIE 0.612 {$<$} 0.001 Confounder 2 NIE 1.115 {$<$} 0.001 Both Confounders NIE 0.643 {$<$} 0.001 Clearly, appropriate control needs to be made for confounders. But you knew that, so let's make this a little more complicated. Example 2 We'll take the same model as before, but now we'll violate assumption 4 by introducing an association between the treatment and the mediator-outcome confounder: The only change is that there is now one additional path, \textbackslash (X \textbackslash rightarrow C\_2\textbackslash ). We'll generate the data: C1},

  abstract = {The purpose is to investigate the influence from early home background factors on achievement in reading, math and science. The effect of SES on school achievement has in Sweden been shown to be fairly large and stable across studies. However, less is known about what role early educational activities at home and early skills may have on achievement differences found in grade 4. With the TIMSS and PIRLS 2011 study a unique opportunity to investigate this matter in some detail is offered, as pupils in grade 4 have been tested in the three subject domains, and their parents provide information on a wide range of early home activities, early reading and numerical skills and other potential influences from the children's homes. In this paper the data from the Swedish participation has been utilized for analyzing such relationships. A latent variable approach was adopted and the effects of early home factors were investigated in a path analysis, which allowed determination of direct and indirect effects. The results show a somewhat differential pattern of relations for math achievement as compared to science and reading. No gender differences were found in any of the factors that were related to achievement in grade 4, whilst boys were found to have a higher average performance in math and science and girls in reading.},

Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials.},

Such causal mediation analyses aim to understand the mechanisms that explain the treatment effect. Although multiple mediators are often involved in real studies, most of the literature considered mediation analyses with one mediator at a time. In this article, we consider mediation analyses when there are causally non-ordered multiple mediators. Even if the mediators do not affect each other, the sum of two indirect effects through the two mediators considered separately may diverge from the joint natural indirect effect when there are additive interactions between the effects of the two mediators on the outcome. Therefore, we derive an equation for the joint natural indirect effect based on the individual mediation effects and their interactive effect, which helps us understand how the mediation effect works through the two mediators and relative contributions of the mediators and their interaction. We also discuss an extension for three mediators. The proposed method is illustrated using data from a randomized trial on the prevention of dental caries.},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of recent developments in mediation analysis, that is, analyses used to assess the relative magnitude of different pathways and mechanisms by which an exposure may affect an outcome. Traditional approaches to mediation in the biomedical and social sciences are described. Attention is given to the confounding assumptions required for a causal interpretation of direct and indirect effect estimates. Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators. Further flexible modeling strategies arising from the precise counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects are also described. The focus throughout is on methodology that is easily implementable in practice across a broad range of potential applications.},

  abstract = {These data explore the impact of job loss and unemployment on workers' stress and mental health, and evaluate the potential benefits of participation in a job-search skills seminar. Respondents were recruited from four offices of the Michigan Employment Security Commission (MESC) in southeastern Michigan. A group of 31,560 unemployed persons were approached for the study. Of these, about 23,000 failed to meet basic initial criteria because they were new entrants to the labor market, already re-employed, or just accompanying others in line. Respondents were kept in the pool if they were not on strike and not expecting to be recalled for work in the next few months or planning to retire in the next two years. The resulting group of 7,956 were then assessed for symptoms of depression and willingness to participate in a job-seeking skills seminar. These final exclusion criteria resulted in a pool of 3,402. A screening questionnaire (Part 1) was administered to that pool, which allowed the researchers to classify respondents as being at high risk for depression and anxiety or at low risk. All of the high-risk respondents and a random sample of the low-risk participants were invited to participate in the study and in the MESC's Job Opportunities and Basic Skills II (JOBSII) intervention program, which consisted of a set of job-search skills seminars. JOBS II was patterned after JOBS I, which was offered by the MESC in the late 1980s. A pretest questionnaire (Part 2) was mailed to respondents between February and July 1991, two weeks prior to the invitation to participate in the JOBS intervention seminar. The questionnaire addressed the situation surrounding the respondents' loss of employment, quality of work life in previous job, level of economic hardship, attitudes toward obtaining a new job, social support network, self-esteem, feelings of anxiety and/or depression, health problems, and substance abuse history and related problems. At the same time, a mail questionnaire was sent to each respondent's significant other (Part 6). Items in this questionnaire focused on the length of their relationship with the respondent, the level of support given to the respondent, the significant other's observations regarding the daily activities of the respondent during this period of job loss, the significant other's feelings of anxiety and/or depression, and the significant other's level of economic hardship. A second and third mail questionnaire were sent six weeks (Part 3) and six months (Part 4) after the respondents' participation in a JOBS intervention program job-seeking skills seminar. For those respondents who had gained employment, questions were asked regarding current employment status, sense of job permanence, employee benefits, and feelings toward current job. Those respondents still seeking employment were queried about their intention to continue their job search, job-seeking behaviors, confidence in their ability to obtain a job, and the presence or lack of a social support network. For those respondents still unemployed six months after the intervention seminar, additional questions covered receipt of unemployment benefits and how necessary those benefits were. Similarly, significant others were queried both six weeks (Part 7) and six months (Part 8) after the respondents' participation in the job intervention. Topics focused on their relationship with the respondent, the observed daily activities of the respondent, the emotional support given to the respondent, the respondent's job-seeking behavior, the respondent's and significant other's feelings of anxiety and/or depression, and the level of shared responsibility regarding the payment of bills and other economic hardships. Finally, respondents were questioned through a mail survey two years (Part 5) after their participation in the intervention seminar about their employment status, quality of work life, financial strain endured, social support system, relationship satisfaction, self-esteem, feelings of anxiety and/or depression, health, and sense of control. Significant others were also queried after two years (Part 9) regarding their relationship with the respondent, the significant other's familiarity with the respondent's feelings of anxiety and/or depression, their social support network, and the significant other's feelings of anxiety and/or depression. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, education, marital status, age of children in household, number of financial dependents, and household income. Background information on significant others includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, education, and employment status. Following the conclusion of the JOBS intervention program, respondents were asked to complete a mail questionnaire (Part 10) evaluating the effectiveness of the program agenda and assessing the relevance of the seminar to their job search, the effectiveness of the seminar trainers, inoculation against setbacks, impact on their self-esteem, effect on their interviewing skills, and resume preparedness.},

  abstract = {{${'}$}Immersing himself in the whirling uncertainty of late modernity, confronting its odd deformities of essentialism and exclusion, Jock Young has produced a comprehensive account of contemporary trouble, anxiety, and transgression. If this is criminology-and it{${'}$}s surely criminology of the best sort-it is a criminology able to account not just for crime and inequality, but for the cultural and the economic, for the existential and the ontological as well. Perhaps most importantly, it is a criminology designed to discover in these intersecting social dynamics real possibilities for critique, hope, and human transformation. Jock Young{${'}$}s The Vertigo of Late Modernity is a work of sweeping-dare I say, dizzying-intellect and imagination.{${'}$} - Professor Jeff Ferrell, Texas Christian University, USA, and University of Kent, UK {${'}$}This is precisely what readers would expect from the author of two instant classics: a book that is bound to become the third. As is his habit, Jock Young launches a frontal attack on the {${'}$}commonsense{${'}$} of social studies and its tacit assumptions - as common as they are misleading. Futility of the {${'}$}inclusion vs exclusion{${'}$}, {${'}$}contented vs insecure{${'}$}, or indeed {${'}$}normal vs deviant{${'}$} oppositions in the globalised and mediatized world is exposed and the subtle yet thorough interpenetration of cultures and porosity of boundaries demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. The newly coined analytical categories, like chaos of rewards and chaos of identity, existential vertigo, bulimic society or conservative vs liberal modes of othering are bound to become an indispensable part of social scientific vernacular - and let{${'}$}s hope that they will, for the sanity and relevance of the social sciences{${'}$} sake{${'}$}- Zygmunt Bauman, Emeritus Professor of Sociology, University of Leeds {${'}$}Jock Young is one of the great figures in the history of criminology. In this book he prises open paradoxes of identity in late modernity. We experience an emphasis on individualism in an era when shallow soil forms a foundation for self-development. Young deftly analyses shifts in conditions of work and consumption and the insecurities they engender. This is a perceptive reformulation of job, family and community in late modernity{${'}$}- Professor John Braithwaite, Australian National University The Vertigo of Late Modernity is a seminal new work by Jock Young, author of the bestselling and highly influential book, The Exclusive Society.In his new work Young describes the sources of late modern vertigo as twofold: insecurities of status and of economic position. He explores the notion of an underclass and its detachment from the class structure. The book engages with the ways in which modern society attempts to explain deviant behaviour - whether it be crime, terrorism or riots - in terms of motivations and desires separate and distinct from those of the {${'}$}normal{${'}$}. Young critiques the process of othering whether of a liberal or conservative variety, and develops a theory of {${'}$}vertigo{${'}$} to characterise a late modern world filled with inequality and division. He points toward a transformative politics which tackle problems of economic injustice and build and cherish a society of genuine diversity.This major new work engages with some of the most important issues facing society today. The Vertigo of Late Modernity is essential reading for academics and advanced students in the areas of criminology, sociology, cultural studies, anthropology and the social sciences more broadly.},
